When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Usually when working with a team you have to keep them up to date with changes you make. Also when you find yourself working in multiple machine having a remote repo can make it easier to make changes anywhere you go.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Just like commits you want to make have control of what you are pulling. Your interest might be on an specific branch (master) and not other branches your  teammates are working on.
